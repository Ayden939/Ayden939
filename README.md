👋 Hi there, I’m Ayden Haslam!
🎓 I’m a recent Computer Science graduate (BSc) who enjoys full-stack web development, algorithms, and creative problem-solving.
💻 I love building, learning, and exploring what’s possible in tech. I'm still finding my niche and excited to dive deeper into new projects and technologies.

🚀 What I’ve Worked On
🔧 Full-Stack Web Projects – University coursework and personal projects using modern stacks.

🖥️ Command-Line Interface Tools – Built from scratch to improve efficiency and user workflows.

🧩 Algorithms & Data Structures – I really enjoy solving challenging problems and improving solutions.

🌱 What I’m Exploring
Game Development in Godot - Collaborating with a group of peers from university!

I’m exploring different fields within tech to find what excites me most. 
I’m especially curious about how technology intersects with nature. 
Through my work at a nature center, I’ve often wondered how these two worlds can become more closely connected.

TOP - Currently going through The Odin Project for more experience and projects.

🍳 Cooking is one of my favorite (and hopefully delicious) ways to unwind.

📚 I’m writing a book and am really enjoying the process.
